<h3>Vlad</h3>
	<p>
Vlad was a one-of-a-kind bat.  He hunted monsters at night and with sonar.  When he found a monster, Vald was only too happy to fly in close and give it the "kiss of death."  Unfortunately, a dragon objected, and Vald lost his life to the cause.  He was known for his sympathetic ears around the office and is greatly missed.

<h3>NightMare</h3>
	<p>
NightMare was an exceptional monster hunter.  He had extraordinary senses and loved the hunt.  NightMare ran fast and was relentless in his pursuit of the quickest monsters.  He was also wise and knowledgeable regarding them.  His best hunts were at dusk and dawn.  NightMare was taken unexpectedly when he was resting during night by a ferocious cerberus and her children.  We mourn his loss.

	<h3>Imelda</h3>
	<p>
Imelda was the consumate scientist.  She worked in every area that could help us in our fight.  She was dedicated to our safety and our knowledge.  But, Imelda went over the line and "melded" herself with a monster she thought she could control - a mind-numbing siren.  She lost that struggle, and some day, we will have to confront her in battle.  Until then, Imelda and her monster will be watched - hoping that Imelda will gain control as she had planned.

<h3>Alex "The Shiv"</h3>
	<p>
Alex "The Shiv" was known for his knife skills and ability to lift a horse over his head.  He excelled in hand-to-hand combat and always carried 13 knives, saying that was his lucky number.  To this day, we believe that if he had had a 14th knife, the scissor-handed barber walrus would not have been able to cut Alex down in the prime of his life.  His sense of humor was a big as his biceps, and we miss him.

<h3>Scuba Daiva</h3>
	<p>
Daiva loved swimming in the oceans and seas of the world - and she travelled them all.  She was the best sea-monster hunter we have ever known until she was taken by a gang of Xanthidae.  These rubble crabs had found a way to deliver their deadly poison through stingers, and Delja was killed protecting a family of dolphins from certain death.  Daiva was as beautiful as she was deadly, and we will never have such a sea-monster hunter again.  She is deeply missed.
