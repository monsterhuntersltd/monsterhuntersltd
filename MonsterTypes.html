<h2>Dragons</h2>

Stats:

Special Powers - flying, or swimming, breathing fire, razor sharp tallons 
Region - WorldWide (India, China, England, not North America 
	
<h3>
Description:
</h3>
<p>
Probably the monster we think we know the most about; and yet their culture and nuances remain a mystery. Even the different species have not yet all been classified; Proffesor Charles W Kholkikos is the current leading world expert (he is living in the Caucasus mountain region of Georgia). Yet these creatures continue to be a big problem when you're trying keep your sheep and children alive if you happen to be in a flight path or nesting region of one of these Leviathans; or winged death delivering deamons(as more commonly known). 
</p>
<p>
The best things you can do to protect yourself; move away from those more dangerous areas. If that is not an option thenyou may want to try planting fresh eucalyptus trees around your property as the fresh smell and the health benefits(especially the moisturizing nature) calms dragons immensely. Those dry itchy scales of theirs absorbs the naturally produced oils in the air giving them a silky shine and making the dragon eternally grateful. 
</p>
<p>
Another option would be to try to raise an orphaned dragon as a pet to ward off all others. Risks may include but are not limited to: being scratched apart by their tiny claws, being accidentally roasted alive from caughs and unintentional fire breathing, or haing limbs removed when the dragon is trying to get your attention. For all these reasons and more it is not recomended to be undertaken by the faint of heart. If you can survive the teenage years you'll have a friend for life (as they live much longer than you).

<h2>Griffins</h2>

Stats:

Height-
Special Powers - flying, razor sharp tallons,  undimishing loyalty to whomever they bond with 
Region - Greece, Israel, Syria and the United Kingdom
	
<h3>
Description:
</h3>
<p>
These cryptic creatures of confounding loyalty are the centerpiece of many legends and folklore. They were first discovered by the greeks as the natural historian Pliny the Elder was one of the first humans to gain the trust of one of these magnificent creatures. The griffin was found by Pliny as a an orphaned baby; he named it Aras. The loyalty of griffins is earned for life and Aras was his loyal companion until his untimely death at 35. It has never been confirmed but the legend is that Pliny had displeased the god Artemis who was jealous that a human had earned the love and loyalty of one such amazing beast. She had her friend Slene the Nymph poison him when he was drinking from a river. It is also possible the river was simply not potable and he did not boil before use.
</p>
<p>
Griffons live hundreds of years, and they mate for life. This is beautiful and yet terrifying as mate disputes have been known to get so violent that their wing flaps cause thunderstorms that wreck ships at sea. Yet, they always work it out and feathers grow back. The oldest known pair were: Pallas and Grinnail
</p>
<p>
Griffins are incredibly strong, and have few known enemies other than . They don't frequently trouble humans as they feel we are a less intelligent race prone to disloyalty (which is true). You're only likely to experience an issue if you have a quarrel with someone who has the loyalty of a griffin; at which point we cannot be called out to help you. Your best hope is to make ammends with said enemy or accept your horrific death, as the griffin will rip you apart and eat you alive.

<h2>Krakens</h2>
<!-- status skill bars with Java script next to picture -->
<!--bandw monster picture -->
Stats:
Strength - 
Height-
Special Powers - Swimming, super powerful stomach acid to quickly dissolve it live prey, operatic singing voice to lure ships and submarines closer 
Region - Mediteranian and Black seas, with a small population in the Pacific near Malaysia 
<h3>
Description:
</h3>
<p>
These giant squid-like monsters are the some of the largest beasts our team is capable to deal with give our current team's strengths. These deadly, disastorous and discerning death machines are an oceanic top predator, not to be engaged with lightly. These great beasts lure ships and sea men often into precarious parts of the pacific where they can more easily pick off their prey, while they are pendulously poised on rock precipices. 
</p>
<p>
Krakens are ovoviparious(having eggs internally that hatch just prior to live births), and give birth to 2 million infant crackens every 300 years. The females kill their male partners post insemination. Fortunately, they have a inverse population growth and high infant mortality. Krakens are also highly territorial with a home range of over 7000 hectares, so the younger krakens often loose in territory conflicts. 
</p>
<p>
For the remaining population, beware the seas as these monsters frequently plunder ships in partnership with Leviathans (distant cousins), and elusive Plesiosauria. The alliance between these creatures has become more common as climate change, as a result of excessive Carbon emissions, over fishing, and waste dumping into our waters, has been increasing at an exponential rate. These monsters are not to be tangled with lightly and we cannot currently take contracts if you happen to belong to international conglomerants that are responsible for these issues. 
</p>

Weaknesses:
</h3>
<p>
mermaid blood
global warming
fairy dust (unfortunately you need to wait until the monster is above water as fairy dust is water soluble and looses potency in this dissolved state)

<h2>Wendigo</h2>

Stats:
Strength -

Special Powers - Eating Humans and converting humans into more Wendigos
Region - East Coast of Canada
<h3>
Description:
</h3>
<p>
Also known by many other names including: wheetigo, windikouk, wi’ntsigo, wi’tigo, wittikka, atchen, chenoo and kewok. Wendigos are a form of changling, humanoids that are now canibalistic; preying on lonely travellers or groups of people isolated in industrial settings. Wendigos will take consume one human and assume its form and personality to kill more in its viscinity.
<p>
Wendigos are often more prolific in time of conflict, colonization, aggressive and covert racism and cultural genocide. They have often been defeated though through accepting of each others differences, and treating others with kindness.
</p>
<p>
As Wendigo's are humanoids, killing them is against our code of ethics. However, they only prey on the greedy and selfish or isolated humans; so you can practice compassion, generosity and kindness to avoid being eaten. If you are... we cannot be held responsible for your lack of integrity, your poor life choices and generally selfish outlook.

Special Powers - Eating Humans and converting humans into more Wendigos
Region - Russia, Czech Republic, Bosnia, London, Forkes, and Transylvannia 
<h3>
Description:
</h3>
<p>
Unlike in the popularized fictional works including "Twilight" Vampires do not have uses for humans other than for their blood. Vampires are the all anemic, which is unfortunate but their general narcissismm, psycho and sociopathic tendencies make them unable to change their habits in human manipulation, torture and consumption. Vampires enjoy toying with their prey in very sadisticly sexual ways; vampires are known to use mind control on weak or needy humans to lure them into their lurid lairs of licentiousness. 
<p>
There are few ways to completely kill Vampires and our current team have all studied at the Bram Stoker's Institute for Vampirical study and methodology. All current team members graduating in the top 3% of the class. As such we are all very eager when it comes to Vampire hunting and we will take on contracts with great enthusiasm (As Vampires have forefeitted their soul in the process of transformation and acceptance we have no ethical issues with killing vampires).
</p>
<p>
As per Brahm Stoker's methodology, our team comes fully equipped with Aspen stakes, silver tipped weapons, and sunlight lamps (stolen from Appollo himself). If you are looking for an A-class team for your vampire conundrums look no further; this quirky band of quarrelsome and single minded scrappy soldiers has your back. Unless of course, you are weak minded and have already succumbed to the vampire's sultry summons. For family and friends of recently bitten loved ones, we have a post mortem team that does exercisms and tasteful decapitations, stakings and cremation. To ensure your loved one stays dead; ain't nobody got time for dead bodies coming back to life.

<h2>Werewolves</h2>
<!-- status skill bars with Java script next to picture -->

Stats:
Strength - 
Height-
Special Powers - Eating Humans and converting humans into more Wendigos
Region - North America, Norway, Russia 
<h3>
Description:
</h3>
<p>
Werewolves along with Vampires are some of the most fictionally overpopularized monsters we face in our century, they are not cuddly shirtless Taylor Lautner's. Rather ther are salivating, sickeningly stormy savages looking to rip you apart at a moment's notice. Werewolves turn into their gruesome form during the full moon it is true but, they are gruesome and maniacle spectres the rest of the month. 
<p>
Werewolves maintain their own stable population, their bites are actually fatal and do not turn humans. Werewolves also exhibit no self control and thus human remains are usually consumed or found in smaller pieces if found at all. You can avoid these creatures by barring your doors during a full moon, avoiding deep dark woody places, or calling us if you cannot accomplish the aforementioned.
