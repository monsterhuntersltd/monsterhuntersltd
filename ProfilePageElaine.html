<p>
Elaine has been hunting monsters for a long time. She started as a child, getting rid of the monsters under her bed and in her closet (they were real).  To prepare herself to liberate people from monsters as a living, Elaine trained in many skills that she felt would be needed (see abelow).
<br>
After years of training and studying monsters and their habits, Elaine auditioned for a position with Monster Hunters by bringing in the head of a gorbellied, flat-mouthed, flap-dragon.  She got the job and has never looked back since.
Elaine has a great deal of experience and expertise in hunting and tracking all types of monsters, but she specializes in underground monsters. She loves searching unknown terrain for signs of underground monsters, including  flap-dragons and puttocks.  
<br> 
To help out a Spartan Race that was being harrassed by a mewling swag-bellied puttock, Elaine donned her racing gear and joined in.  She caught scent of the monster, veered off the race and tracked the monster to its lair.  After ridding the Earth of one more predator.  She returned to the race and finished.  No matter what Elaine is involved in, once she is on the scent of a monster, she will hunt it and  make sure to finish the job.  No monster is too big or too fierce for her to tackle.  In fact, Elaine loves the hands-on approach...
In her free time, Elaine mentors the younger monster hunters, keeps up on her exercise routine, knits, paints, and bakes bread. <!-- Robyn Added breaks -->
