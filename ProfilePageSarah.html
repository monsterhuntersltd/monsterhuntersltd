<!--Dragonâ€™s Dogma and other RPG Charater Profiles for Inspiration -->
<p> Just your average archer, dragon hunter extraordinair with her trusty hell-hound Captain Frederick Wentworth at her side to solve all of your goulish creature conundrums. I do have a soft spot for some of your more harmless leviathan and adjusting werewolf but otherwise I am the ruthless monster slayer here to save you Saturday from certain savagery in the Middle Nomadian District of Noom.
