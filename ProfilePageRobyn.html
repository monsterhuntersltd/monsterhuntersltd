<!--Robyn added content to her profile page -->
<p> Although she is a hunter, Robyn will target Monsters that are causing harm but she will investigate why and more often she is able to make peace with them, but if not, well look out! Robyn has always had an affinity for animals and nature ever since she was a young child. 
<br>She first became interested in the supernatural at the age of 12, when she stumbled upon a werewolf that had be stabbed with a silver stake, thankfully for the werewolf the attacker had missed the mark. It had snarled and snapped at Robyn, but understanding the creatures language was able to calm it down to be able to remove the stake that was preventing it from healing. That moment forward, the wolf knew there was something different about her. So when the wolf was in himan form, she tracked down Robyn to thank her and to ask her if she would want to help learn the ways of the supernatural world and its creatures. 
<br>When she had reached the age of 21, she was bestowed the shapeshifing gift and ability to communicate with animals supernatural and human world alike, she has been using this power for good to help ALL those in need.
Some call her the wolf whisperer, as she has of experience in dealing with Werewolves. She has also had experince dealing with Blue Spotted bat winged unicorns, Chimeras, 3 headed muffled white tigers and so many more!
<br>She is quite the chatter box, extremely savvey im hiking thriugh the mountains and forest range, shapeshifting isnsomehing she is working on, hand to hand combat and self defense, her greatest power though...is the power to decieve being happy in nature and small she can pack quite the punch if a monster or human were to cross her.</p>
