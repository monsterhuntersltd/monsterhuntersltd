<!--Sarah Bencic - Dragonâ€™s Dogma and other RPG and video game Charater Profiles for Inspiration -->
<p> Just your average archer, dragon hunter extraordinaire with her trusty hell-hound Captain Frederick Wentworth at her side to solve all of your goulish creature conundrums. Captain Frederick is an excellent tracker, requiring only extensive details regarding your creature or loved one you desire to find, also three articles of importance relating to the individual to be found. On the clumsy side his gigantic paws sometimes get in the way but, don't let that dissuade you! What Frederick lacks in skill and focus he makes up for in positive attitude and ability to make anyone fall in love (with him)! Also his cuddles are known throughout the continent as the best cure for many of our more severe magically inflicted curses and hexes.

<p> I do have a soft spot for some of your more harmless leviathan and adjusting werewolves, but otherwise I am the ruthless monster slayer here to save your Saturday from certain savagery in the Middle Nomadian District of Noom. I have vast experience and trophies from conquests throughout the mountainous regions of Terebithia and Tigres during my apprentiship with the Vampire killing Academy. Also, when I stayed on doing freelance work gouls and gargoyles became some of my specialties. Looking to work more in the Leviathan and Wendigo sectors, but currently enjoying a research sabattical studying the shapeshifting abilities of the Therians and Selkies.
</p>
<p> My tamaniu is a great bear, my star sign is picese and my Meyers Briggs is INFJ. If you think I would be suitable for any of your upcoming quests please request me through our contact form. Pricing and travel details to be arranged on request. I also work with colleagues of mine on more extensive ventures.
